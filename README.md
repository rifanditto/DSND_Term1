# Finding Donors for CharityML [Link] (https://github.com/rifanditto/DSND_Term1/blob/master/projects/p1_charityml/finding_donors.ipynb)

Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.


## Project Brief

In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, applying a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format, I then evaluate several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I optimize the model selected and present it as solution to CharityML.
